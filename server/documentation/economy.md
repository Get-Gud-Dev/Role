# Economy

Because game economies always seem to end up in a strange exploded and messed up state, one of the goals in the design of ggMud is to replace the dollars and dimes of an economy with some 'bigger' ideas.

## Wealth

Wealth is a 'meta stat' decided by a number of factors, most notably local factors and it determines the types of purchases you are able to make. Haggling allows poorer characters to make up small differences in wealth. There are also antisocial actions like swindling and pickpocket that can be utilized to acquire items of value for less than wealthy characters.

Wealthy people can also hire people who are less wealthy than them, allowing them to share your wealth stat for as long as they remain employed with you.

Having high wealth makes you an ideal target for less than desirable types and you will have to adapt your behaviours accordingly, such as hiring bodyguards, or paying off the local guild.

## Trade

Players are free to trade with one another or through various markets which are accessible to them.
