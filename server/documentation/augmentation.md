# Augmentations

An augmentation is a temporary set of effects that apply to a character and behave in the same way that buffs or debuffs would work in a traditional MMO.

- Augmentations have have repeated effects apply over time.

- Augmentations may have a specified duration or conditions to remove or maintain them.

- Augmentations carry out effects and so the limit to what they can do is the limit to what the engine can do.

- Augmentations may be applied from effects so they can given to the player in almost any set of circumstances.
