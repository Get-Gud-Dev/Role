# Bard Song

Bard Song is just news, 'Barded' skill sets are skills that are able to connect to the wire and utilize the power of past stories told stories.

Barding is a social activity and requires heavily advanced INT, WIS, CHA, DEX and AGI. A barded character won't feel the effects of their own songs but instead gain their boosts from the enjoyment of others.

When bards are playing, characters are free to browse their collection of music to put together a particular set of effects they are after. Getting the song is another matter which requires a little bit of karma
