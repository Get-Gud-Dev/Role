# Creation

Role Players are given the gift of creation. Nearly all elements of gameplay are within the sphere of player control should they desire it. 

## Areas Beyond Creation

Role players are not allowed to create or modify the following aspects of the game:

- The Base Statistics or for the most part, how they behave. (some exceptions may exist in zone specific settings). You are free to roll against and utilize these skills but never shall there be more. (Meta Stats are a different story....)
- Skills or Actions whose behaviour interacts too closely with the game engine. Currently those skills are:
    - None!
- The core mechanics of combat, social and general gameplay. There's room for modifiers and additions but the game should feel uniform throughout on that basic level.

## Areas of Explicit Creation

Some areas should be arranged to be obscenely easy to create content for. The objective is to make all content creation mechanics easy to use- but by their merits, some will be more easy than others.

- Map making and decorating
- Quest Building
- Item Creation
- Creating simple, unique entities (containers, shelves, switches)
- Drawing sprites and textures
- Adding Skills, Actions and Augmentations.
- (Probably) adding and embedding items into imperitives.
- Adding secrets to things
- Expanding NPC dialogs
- Creating Books

## Tools of Creation

Each aspect of creation should have a custom built tool, and these tools should feel as though they are a part of the game.
