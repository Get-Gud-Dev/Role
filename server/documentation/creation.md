Role Players are given the gift of creation. Nearly all elements of gameplay are within the sphere of player control should they desire it. 

# Areas Beyond Creation

- The Base Statistics or for the most part, how they behave. (some exceptions may exist in zone specific settings).
- Skills or Actions whose behaviour interacts too closely with the game engine. Currently those skills are:
    - None!
