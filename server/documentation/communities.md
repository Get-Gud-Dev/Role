# Levels of Community

One way to categorize communities, but not an entirely correct way is by number of inhabitants. This is a count of player operated characters and NPC's.

## Friendship

There are degrees here. People you have positive social actions with gradually become your friends

## Party (1-7)

A very temporary grouping of people, this relationship should be drawn automatically when possible.

## Camp (1-20)

When a party accumulates enough XP in an area it can evolve into a camp. Camps provide buildable space and can be a foci for crafters and traders as well as adventurers to come and expand the camp and keep the fight going.

Camp productivity is based on XP / unit of time for the area, as the camp grows larger, so does the area's potential productivity. 

## Raid (20-150)



## Fellowship (5-9)

A longer term, formalized agreement between multiple parties. Fellowship is a way of level jumping to high friendship status with a group of 5-9 people. A fellowship must be given some overarching objective and if a member of the fellowship doesn't return to the meeting point in a week or more, they are considered to have fallen on the journey and may not rejoin.

## Village (10-20)

A township is the first form of a true long-term physical manifestation of community. Villages **must** be contained in the same zone and require the following basic conditions to work:

- Access to clean water
- Access to food supplies (via trade route or direct proximity)
- Access to the materials used in the construction of their village to maintain it.
- A character assigned as leader, with their own home which will become the village's form of 'city hall'
- At least one tradesperson

The leader of a village must sign off on construction within his own territory and those who live within his domain contribute to his overall wealth and status.

## Township (20-100)

A township must have facility to support a much larger number of people. Townships may still only consist of multiple zones, though their range of influence is much greater than the largest of villages. A township is not considered livable without the following:

- Trade & Travel access to at least one other village or bigger.
- A proper notary (this individual can be made 'proper' by the leader of the community)
- At least 3 tradespeople, one trader
- 

## City (100-500+)

A city meets the needs of a township but is not a metropolis

## Metropolis (100-500+)

A metropolis must have everything and the people to back it. Metropolis may be contained within multiple zones. In order to qualify as a metropolis, the city must have:

- At least one full zone under the dominion of the City
- All requirements from lower tiers plus adjusted values for items below:
- Trade & Travel access (direct or indirect) two at least 3 towns or larger by at least 2 means.
- Interior travel access by at least 1 means.
- At least one resident guild hall
- At least one foreign embassy domestic and abroad
- At least 12 tradespeople representing 6 of the trades and 10 traders.
- At least two complete caravan services that offer access to the global market
- Full medical services (Hospital with staff trained in a medical branch)
- Significant justice services, a legal process and a system of laws a guard staff of 1 for every 25 citizens.
