# Vehicle
*Return to [Entity Model](../README.md)*

Vehicles are able to take the energy output of engines and convert them into motion.

## Vehicle Speed

The rate that the vehicle accelerates at is found using the power output of the engines connected to the vehicle and the mass of the vehicle.

The top speed of the vehicle is found by looking at the mass of the vehicle and the amount of drag the vehicle has.

### Vehicle Drag

Vehicle drag can be found by looking at what is attached to the vehicle, the following factors are considered in coming up with a drag coefficient:
- Volume of the Vehicle
- Weight of the Vehicle

## Turn speed

Turning speed is a function of the length of the vehicle. Either an overheated brain or legit conclusions are telling me that I'll probably want to tweak the coefficients that come with this after I see them in game.
