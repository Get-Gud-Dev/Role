# Maps
*return to [Technical Considerations](../README.md)*

Maps define the player's game space. Currently, the design limits players onto a grid. A map needs the following qualities in order to function properly:

## Map Scale
Maps can have any scale, all values for height maps are expressed in meters. 

## Map Map Height Data
Currently I am trying to roll my own version of this, you can read more about that in the [Height Maps](height-maps.md) article.

## RayCasting
I am going to go for the raycasting method even though I am pretty sure it is a dumb idea.

You can read about that endeavour in the [RayCasting](raycast.md) article.
