# Vehicles

We all know what a vehicle is. Vehicle is actually a component that can be attached to an entity.

## Vehicle properties

Acceleration : A property found by the force the vehicle can emit divided by the total weight of the vehicle, cargo, and occupants.

Towable : Determines if the vehicle is capable of being towed.

## Engine

Vehicles require an engine to drive them but need not necessarily have one.

Engines are a separate component that can put out a certain amount of force. Vehicles look for engine components attached to them or their parent entities.

A towing vehicle can be configured as a master or a slave, to be driven from the master or to be driven from the vehicle being towed.

**Seats** Each seat in a vehicle requires you to describe the mount point for the character and specify if that seat has control of the vehicle.

**Capacity** Additional storage space available on the vehicle

## Driving Vehicles

Vehicles should have ground restrictions such that carriages can not be taken off of roads and so forth.

An animal can be vehicularized, a person may be vehicularized, they must be able to carry the passenger or cargo, or else they will suffer the encumberance penalties.

### Not Driving Vehicles

You can hire players to drive for you or staff yourself out with a non player-driver.

The risk to you is the chance for rewards and so there's no real penalty for a player taking a job for you and messing it up.
