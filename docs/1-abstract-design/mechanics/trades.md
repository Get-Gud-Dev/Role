# Trades
*return to [Game Mechanics](README.md)*

Items in the game may be designed to be craftable by tradespeople.

# Creating Items

In order to make an item craftable by tradespeople you need to provide a detailed material breakdown of what makes up the item.

# Refining Resources

One branch of the trades is Refining, every trade should have some kind of material refining involved as in the world it is rare that resources go straight from the wild to service.

## Refining Requirements

Refining always requires the material to be refined, it also needs to know the type of refinement that will be applied to the object.

A refinement can also require a particular entity or item like a processing table or tool.

A refinement can require an Action to perform, or it can be solely based on a skill, or be completely open.
