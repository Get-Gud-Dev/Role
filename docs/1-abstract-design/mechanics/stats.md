## 20 Based Statistics

The maximum value a statistic can have is 20. This is correlate to the game's tendency to perform rolls between 1-20 (traditionally, a d-20 or 20 sided die).

This means that someone with a 20 in any stat is considered to be a never-failing god in that department.

Someone who has a stat level at 5 or below is considered to be far below average where 10 is considered average.
