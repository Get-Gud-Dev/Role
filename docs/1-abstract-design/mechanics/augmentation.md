# Augmentations
*return to [Game Mechanics](README.md)*

An augmentation is a temporary set of [effects](effects.md) that apply to a [character](character.md) and behave in the same way that buffs or debuffs would work in a traditional MMO.

- Augmentations have have repeated [effects](effects.md) apply over time.

- Augmentations may have a specified duration or conditions to remove or maintain them.

- Augmentations carry out [effects](effects.md) and so the limit to what they can do is the limit to what the engine can do.

- Augmentations may be applied from [effects](effects.md) so they can given to the player in almost any set of circumstances.
