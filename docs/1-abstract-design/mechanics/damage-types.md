# Damage Types
*return to [Game Mechanics](README.md)*

Different damage types represent different ways that hurt can be applied to a character. Examples of obvious damage types include: crushing, piercing, falling, fire/burning- etc...

## Procs

Proc [effects] can be applied to damage types such that whenever that type of damage is dealt, there is a chance that the effect will be applied to the recipient.

Examples would include bleeding [augmentations](augmentation.md) on slashing damage. Broken Legs on falling damage, etc.

## Armor Modifiers

Damage types can have plus or minus modifiers that apply to different types of armor.
