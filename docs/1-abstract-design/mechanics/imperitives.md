# Imperitives
*return to [Game Mechanics](README.md)*

## Needs

### Food and Water

Depending on the attributes of your character, you will have a varying ideal amount of daily calories you need to eat in order to stay healthy. You will also need between 2 and 3 litres of water.

Generally speaking, your character is capable of managing their own calorie intake- however if your character possesses low resolve, they may double eat whenever they feel hungry. Likewise a character with low awareness is unlikely to notice that they are hungry and will tend to go too long without eating foods.

These values are mostly deducted from stamina so a character at rest for a day will have very low requirements.

### Hunger

Hunger decreases effective strength in degrees. After a time, your intelligence and dexterity will start to drain and eventually you will die.

A person can survive weeks without food but the augmentations will make doing anything nearly impossible and dangerous.

### Over-Eating

Over-eating puts you in a gastronomically compromised state, affecting all branches of physicality and introduce faltering rolls against dexterity to physical actions. 

Over-eating also decreases your agility and this decrease gets worse the further you go, after a while your dexterity starts to drain until you become obese.

Obese characters are capped at 6 STR, DEX, and AGI but get -2 on all charm rolls.

### Thirst

Being thirsty drops your resolve, strength, dexterity, agility and tenacity. If you continue intro dehydration you will die in about three days.

### Social

Players with high charm, low wisdom, or low resolve have a higher social imperitive than others. Performing any action which costs social energy will replenish social need.

Committing antisocial acts will fill in your loneliness but comes with side effects.

The first is you're likely to be branded a criminal. The other thing that can happen is a drift into insanity or the emergence of a new imperitive: BloodLust

Low rolls are performed against Resolve when you kill something. If you fail the roll, your social need will increase, killing too much when you are in dire need of socialization will leave you Desensitized. Frustrating situations may cause you to respond with violence in a desensitized state.
