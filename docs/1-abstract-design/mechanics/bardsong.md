# Bard Song
*return to [Game Mechanics](README.md)*

Bard Song is not literally the song of bards, it is an outlet to the news and communication network in your area, 'Barded' skill sets are skills that are able to connect to the wire and utilize the power of past [stories](story.md).

Barding is a [social](social.md) activity and requires heavily advanced INT, WIS, CHA, DEX and AGI. A barded character won't feel the effects of their own songs but instead gain their boosts from the enjoyment of others.

# Non Bard Uses


## Build-Augment

When bards are playing, characters are free to browse their collection of music (tales, pieces of entertainment) to put together a particular set of [effects](effects.md) they are after. Enjoying the song and feelings its effects costs the listener a bit of [Karma](karma.md), so it is in their best interest to stick around for a bit and enjoy some other songs before taking off with the [augmentation](augmentation.md).

## Questing

Another way to use a bard is to draw quest inspiration from the stories that you see.
