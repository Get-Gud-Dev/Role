# Bard Song
*return to [Game Mechanics](README.md)*

Bard Song is not literally the song of bards, it is an outlet to the news and communication network in your area, 'Barded' skill sets are skills that are able to connect to the wire and utilize the power of past [stories](story.md).

Barding is a [social](social.md) activity and requires heavily advanced INT, WIS, CHA, DEX and AGI. A barded character won't feel the effects of their own songs but instead gain their boosts from the enjoyment of others.

# Being Barded

## Acquiring new Stories

Barded characters, with the help of some conduit are able to connect to a stream of local happenings, and they use relationships with other bards in other regions to get information from other streams. A well travelled bard will always have more to tell.

Other sources for bardsong include rumours, where Bards can be largely responsible for the rumor becoming truth.

## Conduits

Conduits are means for Barded characters to channel bardsongs wholecloth. This can be a technological process, magical, whatever- generally the keys to proper conduit design are that they go where your adventurers are going to go to rest up, and that they rely on more than one person to establish.

## Telling Epics

Epic Tales are recountings of great events that have happened. Hearing these tales gives adventurers benefits reminiscient of the original hero.

# Encountering a Barded Character

## Augment Building

When bards are playing, characters are free to browse their collection of music (tales, pieces of entertainment) to put together a particular set of [effects](effects.md) they are after. Enjoying the song and feelings its effects costs the listener a bit of [Karma](karma.md), so it is in their best interest to stick around for a bit and enjoy some other songs before taking off with the [augmentation](augmentation.md).

## Quest Building

Another way to use a bard is to draw quest inspiration from the stories that are available. Either by taking a tale in complete or mixing and matching elements, new quests can be forged.
