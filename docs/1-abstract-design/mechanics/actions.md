# Actions

Actions are things that a character can do. Actions should be highly configurable, borderline scriptable and represent the most general sense of character agency.

## Parts of an action

### Failure / Success

The success or failure of an action can depend on a number of factors, but usually comes down to a roll.

A **trivial action** is one that can be performed by the player with 100% success. Actions my become trivialized after some skill or stat reaches a desired threshold, or simply by their nature be trivial to perform.

Success chances can also be affected by character state, environment, enemy state.

### Outcome

Depending on the success chance and roll, an outcome is decided. 

Outcomes are groups of effects, so once the right outcome is chosen, all of the effects specified by it will be applied to the the target of the outcome.
