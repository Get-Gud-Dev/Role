# Actions
*return to [Game Mechanics](README.md)*

Actions are things that a character can do. Actions should be highly configurable, borderline scriptable and represent the most general sense of character agency.

## Parts of an action

### Failure / Success

The success or failure of an action can depend on a number of factors, but usually comes down to a [roll](rolls.md).

A **trivial action** is one that can be performed by the player with 100% success. Actions my become trivialized after some [skill](skills.md) or [stat](stats.md) reaches a desired threshold, or simply by their nature be trivial to perform.

Success chances can also be affected by [character](character.md) state, environment, enemy state.

### Outcome

Depending on the success chance and roll, an outcome is decided. 

Outcomes are groups of [effects](effects.md), so once the right outcome is chosen, all of the effects specified by it will be applied to the the target of the outcome.
