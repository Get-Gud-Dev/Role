*return to [Game Mechanics](README.md)*

Extreme enough acts will be witnessed by any characters in line of sight. If they can, they will report you to local authorities.

Some NPC's or players may be willing to accept bribe to have their ability to report you wiped. Most probably won't, you could attempt to kill them but this would only create more evidence.

Beyond witnesses, you will always leave behind evidence that is likely to be found by a player which can be turned into a guard.

Depending on the nature of the act, the local authority's response will vary and are defined by the local authority. The most extreme outcomes being execution, imprisonment, or bountied. All of which will leave you kill on sight.
