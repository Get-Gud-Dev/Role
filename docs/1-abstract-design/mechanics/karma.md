# Karma
*return to [Game Mechanics](README.md)*

Karma is a part of the social system and it matters to everyone. Selfish acts tend to reduce your Karma and Selfless tend to increase it. Karmic relationships are generally patronages. Where one individual is providing a service for another. These kinds of relationships will factor in karma.

## Karma as a Patron

Karma is the reminder to the patron to go out of their way to support the proprieter and ensure that they stay in business.

For Barded characters, a good crowd votes for songs and gives great 'hurrah!'s
(or whatever the local custom is). They will come out of that bar with neutral or positive karma.

A bad crowd takes their buffs and runs, their karma will come out of that bar with negative karma.

## Karma as a Proprieter

Good proprietership, when possible is about modifying your basic experience when possible to try and get the Patron to build more Karma with you. High karma customers (or particularly low karma customers) are regulars and they represent one metric of the size of your proprietership.

For businesses, good proprietership includes giving your customers quests to do and stories, and if possible, links to the trade associations above you.

Does your business require any dangerous and hard-to-source ingredients? Bandits always raiding your shipments? These are all ways the proprieter can get their customers to not only shell out their gold, but also quite a bit of karma.

## Karma to the Patron

A Patron who has poor Karma gets a Karma roll every time they fail an action, if the roll fails they automatically critically fail the action. Feeling the effects of Karma will release you of one point of negative Karma, so eventually the universe will get back at you, you'd be better not having negative karma in the first place.
