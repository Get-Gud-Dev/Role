# Paint Tool

All visuals in the game are drawn by players. Visuals are actually comprised of Classic VGA/Ascii text characters coloured to make images.

# Paint Modes

There are two modes that can be painted in: Environment or Detail

## Environment Painting

Painting environments means painting textures at 'half-resolution'. [Textures](../../technical/rendering-engine/textures.md) are used to give walls, floors, and skies character.

## Detail Painting

Details are painted at twice the resolution of Environments, they are intended to pop out at the user, to help signal interactive content or important parts of the level design.
