*return to [Game Mechanics](README.md)*

Because game economies always seem to end up in a strange exploded and messed up state, one of the goals in the design of ggMud is to replace the dollars and dimes of an economy with some 'bigger' ideas.

## Wealth

Wealth is a 'meta stat' decided by a number of factors, most notably local factors and it determines the types of purchases you are able to make. Haggling allows poorer characters to make up small differences in wealth. There are also antisocial actions like swindling and pickpocket that can be utilized to acquire items of value for less than wealthy characters.

Wealthy people can also hire people who are less wealthy than them, allowing them to share your wealth stat for as long as they remain employed with you.

Having high wealth makes you an ideal target for less than desirable types and you will have to adapt your behaviours accordingly, such as hiring bodyguards, or paying off the local guild.

## Trade and Markets

Players are free to trade with one another or through various markets which are accessible to them. Markets are accessible through brokers of the appropriate market.

### Accessing Markets

If you want access to a market you will to have a contract to distribute the goods. These are up to the creator of the item to create and may be a contract for a single item or many items. Having more contracts means having a greater potential stock.

### Accessing Goods

Once your right to distribute goods has been secured, you also need to secure space for your goods and transportation for the goods themselves.

Transportation is required to maintain the supply chain. Availability of goods is measured in days. If two days pass with significant distruptions in the supply chain. Local law enforcement will struggle to maintain order.

#### Storage

#### Transport Contracts

To create a transport Contract you'll need a vehicle and some form of notary to prepare the document (Not yourself). 

Once the contract is signed, the transporter will need to assure that the goods are delivered according to the terms of the contract.
