# Role 

Going back graphically in hopes of getting back some control. Role seeks to give the players the entire world and let their Roles take over the narrative landscape of the game.

## Development Stage [Dev Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)

### Abstract Design
*Article [Abstract Design](1-abstract-design/README.md)*

Current stage of development with the game engine is **abstract design** basically that means that I just make stuff up with no regard to limitations or possibilities or my future sanity.


### Game Engine - Testing and Development
*Article [Engine Design](2-engine-design/README.md)*

There are aspects of the game engine that are being developed, most notably the rendering engine which was kind of the thing that all of this hinged on. Also, some aspects like raycasting and mapping need to have tests prepared before I can really say much about what they can and can not do.
