# Role

Currently in open design.

A role playing game that puts a heavy emphasis on Role Playing.

## Key Features:
- Traditional XP and levels go out the window.
- Player driven world, quests, characters, stories.
- Space for fandoms to create their own worlds

## Current State of Development

Early design, so early that conclusions can't really be drawn.

## Contributing

Read the various documents in [abstract design](docs/1-abstract-design) and [engine design](docs/2-engine-design), create issues surrounding things that may not work, beg more explanation, etc.
