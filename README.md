# Role

Currently in open design.

A role playing game that puts a heavy emphasis on Role Playing.

## Key Features:
- Traditional XP and levels go out the window.
- Player driven world, quests, characters, stories.
- Space for fandoms to create their own worlds

## Current State of Development

Early design, so early that conclusions can't really be drawn.

## Contributing

Read the various documents in `server/documentation` and `engine/documentation`, create issues surrounding things that may not work, beg more explanation, etc.
